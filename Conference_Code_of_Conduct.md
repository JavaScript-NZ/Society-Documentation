# <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JavaScript-NZ/Society-Logo/master/png/javascript-new-zealand-logo.png" width="100"> JavaScript NZ Conference Code of Conduct

This anti-harassment policy is based on the example policy from the [Geek Feminism wiki](http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Conference_anti-harassment), created by the Ada Initiative and other volunteers.

The following is a template of a Code of Conduct to be adapted and adopted by JavaScript NZ Inc. events. An adapted version of this template is favoured as it allows directly referencing important details specific to the event, such as contact information and how to identify staff members.

Alternatively, events may use the following ready-made Code of Conduct: http://confcodeofconduct.com/


## Short version
    This is a very short version that refers the reader to a longer version of the policy. Suitable for footers on announcement emails, web pages, news stories, etc.

$CONFERENCE is dedicated to a harassment-free conference experience for everyone. Our anti-harassment policy can be found at:

[URL for full anti-harassment policy]

## Medium public version

    This is a statement of the organizers' principles and sets expectations for the tone and style of the conference. Suitable for the conference web site and longer announcements.

$CONFERENCE is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any conference venue, including talks. Conference participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the conference *without a refund* at the discretion of the conference organizers. Our anti-harassment policy can be found at:

[URL for full anti-harassment policy]

## Long public version

    This version focuses on specific instructions to the participants, with the goal of preventing harassment in the first place through education. Suitable for the conference web site and conference program material.

[Insert medium public version of policy here.]

Harassment includes, but is not limited to:

* Verbal comments that reinforce social structures of domination related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, or religion.
* Sexual images in public spaces
* Deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following
* Harassing photography or recording
* Sustained disruption of talks or other events
* Inappropriate physical contact
* Unwelcome sexual attention
* Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behaviour

### Enforcement

Participants asked to stop any harassing behaviour are expected to comply immediately

[Exhibitors in the expo hall, sponsor or vendor booths, or similar activities are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, exhibitors should not use sexualized images, activities, or other material. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualized clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualized environment.]

If a participant engages in harassing behaviour, event organisers retain the right to take any actions to keep the event a welcoming environment for all participants. This includes warning the offender or expulsion from the conference *with no refund*.

Event organisers may take action to redress anything designed to, or with the clear impact of, disrupting the event or making the environment hostile for any participants.

We expect participants to follow these rules at all event venues and event-related social activities. We think people should follow these rules outside event activities too!

### Reporting

If someone makes you or anyone else feel unsafe or unwelcome, please report it as soon as possible. [Conference staff can be identified by t-shirts/special badges/head sets.] Harassment and other code of conduct violations reduce the value of our event for everyone. We want you to be happy at our event. People like you make our event a better place.

You can make a report either personally or anonymously.

#### Anonymous Report

You can make an anonymous report here [[Wufoo](http://www.wufoo.com/) form or similar that DOES NOT require an email address to submit.]

We can't follow up an anonymous report with you directly, but we will fully investigate it and take whatever action is necessary to prevent a recurrence.

#### Personal Report

You can make a personal report by:

* Calling or messaging this phone number: [Phone number for reporting]. This phone number will be continuously monitored for the duration of the event.
* Contacting a staff member, identified by STAFF badges, buttons, or shirts.

When taking a personal report, our staff will ensure you are safe and cannot be overheard. They may involve other event staff to ensure your report is managed properly. Once safe, we'll ask you to tell us about what happened. This can be upsetting, but we'll handle it as respectfully as possible, and you can bring someone to support you. You won't be asked to confront anyone and we won't tell anyone who you are.

Our team will be happy to help you contact hotel/venue security, local law enforcement, local support services, provide escorts, or otherwise assist you to feel safe for the duration of the event. We value your attendance.

## Internal version for conference staff

    This version is intended for internal use by the conference staff. It defines an example enforcement policy that can be tweaked to suit your conference organization style.

### Warnings

Any member of conference staff can issue a verbal warning to a participant that their behaviour violates the conference's anti-harassment policy. Warnings should be reported to [insert email address/phone number/etc. here] as soon as practical. The report should include:

* Identifying information (name/badge number) of the participant
* The time you issued the warning
* The behaviour that was in violation
* The approximate time of the behaviour (if different than the time of warning)
* The circumstances surrounding the incident
* Your identity
* Other people involved in the incident
* [Your guideline here]

### Presentations

Presentations or similar events should not be stopped for one-time gaffes or minor problems, although a member of conference staff should speak to the presenter afterward. However, staff should take immediate action to politely and calmly stop any presentation or event that repeatedly or seriously violates the anti-harassment policy. For example, simply say "I'm sorry, this presentation cannot be continued at the present time" with no further explanation.

### Taking reports

When taking a report from someone experiencing harassment you should record what they say and reassure them they are being taken seriously, but avoid making specific promises about what actions the organizers will take. Ask for any other information if the reporter has not volunteered it (such as time, place) but do not pressure them to provide it if they are reluctant. Even if the report lacks important details such as the identity of the person taking the harassing actions, it should still be recorded and passed along to the appropriate staff member(s). If the reporter desires it, arrange for an escort by conference staff or a trusted person, contact a friend, and contact local law enforcement. Do not pressure the reporter to take any action if they do not want to do it. Respect the reporter's privacy by not sharing unnecessary details with others, especially individuals who were not involved with the situation or non-staff members.

[Repeat information to gather when making a report here]

### Expulsion

A participant may be expelled by the decision of any of the above listed entities for whatever reasons they deem sufficient. However, here are some general guidelines for when a participant should be expelled:

* A [first/second/third/seventeenth] offense resulting in a warning from staff
* Continuing to harass after any "No" or "Stop" instruction
* A pattern of harassing behaviour, with or without warnings
* A single serious offense (e.g., punching or groping someone)
* A single obviously intentional offense (e.g., taking up-skirt photos)
* [Your guideline here]

Hotel/venue security and local authorities should be contacted when appropriate.

[Repeat conf/hotel/venue/law enforcement/hot line contact info here]

### Public statements

As a general rule, conference staff should not make any public statements about the behaviour of individual people during or after the conference.

In general, consult with other staff members when possible but act when necessary.
